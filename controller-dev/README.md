# Gamecube-TAS-Robot - CONTROLLER-DEV
This is the nightmare we're living in, folks. 
This is the C code/collection of code that exists purely to be the interfacing component between an STM32 F7 and another raspberry pi.
This, once finished, should theoretically be able to transfer gigabyte files across itself through either Ethernet or USART, and I'm not sure which makes me want to claw out my eyes less.
The other stuff it has to do - connect to a computer, send 40 byte packets over parallel, use SPI, pretend to grab memory dumps - shouldn't be as garbage.

If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
